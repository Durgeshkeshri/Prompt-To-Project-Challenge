## **🛡️ Step 1: Secure User Registration, Login & Webpage Display (40 Points) - Mandatory**

✅ **User Registration:**  
- Unique **username validation** (must not already exist).  
- **Smart username suggestions** if the entered one is taken.  
- **Password Fortress:**  
  - **Min 8, Max 16 characters**.  
  - Must include **uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character**.  
  - **CANNOT be the same as the username**.  
- **Password Encryption:** Store passwords securely using a **hashing algorithm** (bcrypt, SHA-256, Argon2).  

✅ **Login System:**  
- Authenticate users using **username and password**.  
- **Instant error feedback** for incorrect inputs.  
- **Account logout button** (because security matters).  

✅ **Post-Login Webpage Display:**

## **🤖 Step 2: CAPTCHA & Secure Authentication (15 Points) - Optional**

✅ **CAPTCHA Defense:**  
- A **random, dynamic CAPTCHA** appears every time users log in.  
- Supports **text-based, image-based, or logic-based CAPTCHAs**.  
- Display **error message** when the CAPTCHA is incorrect.  
- Provide a **CAPTCHA refresh button**.  

✅ **Auto-Logout System:**  
- **Session expiration** Kicks in after 2 minutes, requiring the user to log in again (return to login page) —because security never sleeps. 
- Displays a timer showing the remaining seconds or minutes before re-login is required.

## **🎭 Step 3: Role-Based Access Control with Dynamic Pages (20 Points) - Optional**

✅ **Who Are You?**  
- **Admin** → The ruler of the system! Create, view, delete users, and modify system settings.  
- **Moderator** → Can view users, but **no superpowers**.  
- **User** → Regular users enjoying their space.  
- **Guest** → Just vibing, minimal access.  

✅ **Role-Restricted Access:**  
- Each role should see **different dashboards**:  
  - **Admin Panel 🛠️** → Full system control.  
  - **Moderator Dashboard 👀** → Monitor but can’t edit.  
  - **User Profile Page 👤** → Personal dashboard.  
  - **Guest Page 🎭** → Read-only, no interactions.  

✅ **Admin Power Move:**  
- Admin **creates user accounts** with custom roles.  
- Users can only log in **if they have been assigned a role by the Admin**.  
- **Guest users** can log in with just a **unique name and password**.
